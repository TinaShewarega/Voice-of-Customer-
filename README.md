# Voice-of-Customer 

## Case Study from QTM 385: Data Analytics [Emory University]

Hasbro’s eCommerce division does a significant amount of business on Amazon.com. Over the past two quarters, executives have become increasingly nervous about the quality of the products competing with Hasbro products in the toys and games category on Amazon. Anecdotal reports from family members and friends of the executives have been trickling in, many of which have alleged:
* The toys and games category is so diluted with products that are nearly indistin- guishable from Hasbro products that it’s hard to know what is what, and even harder to find the right merchandise when seeking it.
* Many of the products in the category are of such a poor quality that they pose health threats to their children.
* Some Amazon products claim to be Hasbro products online, but when they are received they are clearly counterfeit.

They believe that by employing advanced analytics techniques, they can get ahead of the market by learning what products are becoming more popu- lar over time, or by discerning what products please customers the most. It may even be possible, they believe, to discover product lines they should divest from by listening to the "voice of the customer" for issues in the supply chain and product positioning.
